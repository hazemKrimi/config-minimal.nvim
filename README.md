# My Minimal NeoVim Config

This repo contains my custom minimal NeoVim config for software development.

# Requirements

1. Install [Lua](https://www.lua.org/download.html).

2. Install NeoVim following the [Installation docs](https://neovim.io/doc/install/).

## References

This config is based on [nvim-lite](https://github.com/radleylewis/nvim-lite) following [The Rad Lectures' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYDG3AHgYEs&t=1229s).
